# Factors Surrounding Suicide Rates Across Countries

## Abstract
Reducing suicide rate has been a focal point of many disciplines for decades. It is noted that individualsâ€™ suicides not only affect their families and people surrounding them, they also have societal costs. Moreover, suicide is a major preventable cause of death on a global level. In this study, we study the relationship between suicide rate and variables from different social dimensions across countries, hoping to identify valuable factors that correlate with suicide rate for future research. Our variables include happiness index, temperature, religion, and mental health resources. We used a multivariate regression model and ANOVA to evaluate the significance of each variable. Our result showed that countries in which Islam dominates tend to have lower suicide rate. Depending on the income group of the country, each variable is correlated with suicide rate differently, with temperature showing significance in some income groups.
